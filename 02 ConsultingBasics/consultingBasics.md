# **Consulting Basics**

The [Aiimi Leadership Training Program](https://aiimiltd.sharepoint.com/sites/AiimiLeadershipTraining) will cover this in more depth, but it's important that every engineer joining aiimi knows the basics of consulting from the outset.

The headline is that our customers are **paying a non-trivial amount** for your **expertise and opinions** -- never forget this simple fact.

## **Your job**
Your job is simply to **help the customer to solve their problems**. Often, this will also include **defining** the problem in the first place. Therefore you need to **ask questions**, (think *why* x5).

## **Empathy, empathy, empathy**
Putting yourself in the clients' shoes can help you to understand their motives, aims, pressures, etc. Attempt to truly *understand* their position.

## **How you present yourself**
How you present yourself is critical. Aiimi's style isn't beige-corporate, but it is **professional**.
Treat everyone with respect (which includes being willing them challenge them in order to ultimately help them!).

## **Communication**
Communication is key. Articulate yourself clearly. Understand *who* you are talking to and their level of technical proficiency and tailor your words to suit the audience.

## **Technical expertise**
You need **technical expertise**. Does this mean you have to know the answer to every question? Absolutely not. That's impossible. Your aims should be to: 
1) do the **best you can with the information you have**,
2) do your best to **network & research** to find the answers,
3) be willing to **ask the client for more information** in order to help you find the answers, and
4) **continuously learn** -- the industry is fast-moving and a you need to use your initiative to stay at the sharp-end of what's possible.
