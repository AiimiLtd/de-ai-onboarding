# **An introduction to Scrum & Agile working**

There are numerous guides online about what Scrum is, its benefits, and more. Therefore this won't be an in-depth guide but rather a useful starting point which directs you to further learning.

Useful resources:
* [The Scrum Guide](https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html)

* Tom Witham, Aiimi Head of Delivery


## **Firstly, what is Scrum?**

Scrum is a lightweight framework that helps people, teams and organisations generate value through adaptive solutions for complex problems.

In a nutshell, Scrum requires a Scrum Master to foster an environment where:

* A Product Owner orders the work for a complex problem into a Product Backlog.

* The Scrum Team turns a selection of the work into an Increment of value during a Sprint.

* The Scrum Team and its stakeholders inspect the results and adjust for the next Sprint.

* *Repeat*
