You have been employed because we see that you can add value for our clients. But your journey as a data engineer continues...

## **Continuous Learning**

## **Mentorship**

Everyone at aiimi will have the opportunity to have a mentor, or indeed to be a mentor. This is a great opportunity for us all to learn. It is NOT about hierarchy, it is about sharing knowledge and experience across the organisation so that we, and our clients, all benefit.

## **Role Model**
