## **Our Tech Stack**

Given that we are consultants, the technology we use can vary widely depending on the clients' needs. However, we often operate in the Azure eco-system.


### **Languages**

Before delving into the commonly used components, let's first discuss the programming lanaguages you should seek to become an expert in:

* Python (PySpark)
* SQL

You should understand **Spark/Distributed Compute**

### **Technology**

**Platforms**
* Databricks - This should be the platform you invest most effort in becoming expert in.

* Azure Synapse Analytics - This platform is secondary to Databricks, however the *Pipelines* feature (formerly known as Azure Data Factory) is also worth learning.
  
The Azure eco-system is huge, however the components that we use most commonly are:

* Blob Storage / Data Lake
* Serverless SQL Pool (Synapse Analytics)
* Dedicated SQL Pool (Synapse Analytics)
* Event Hub (For event-trigerred pipelines)
  
Less commonly used, but important:

* CosmosDB (Advanced)

### **Version Control**

Version control should be utilised on *all* client projects. The exact tooling may vary, but typically it is:

* GitHub
* Azure DevOps Repos
