# **Data &amp; AI Engineering onboarding pack**

[In Progress 05/07/2024]

### Welcome to aiimi!

This is your onboarding pack. It is *not* intended to teach you to become a data engineer. Rather, it aims to quickly acclimate you to the aiimi landscape and help you to understand our commonly used approaches and technologies.

In addition, all aiimi employees are enrolled to the Aiimi Leadership Training Program (ALTP), which will help develop you further as a consultant at aiimi.

Note that '00 Resources' contains *at a glance* documents which should help you during client engagements. Use these when you need quick inspiration.

The rest of the curricula is in its suggested order.
